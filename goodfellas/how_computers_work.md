# How Computers Work

### CPU (Central Processing Unit):
A series of circuits that process the commands which run the computer, and interface with the input and output devices, or hardware.  The CPU receives information from RAM (see below), as well as input and output devices.

### RAM (Random Access Memory):
Programs and the Operating System (Windows/Mac/Linux) are loaded into RAM either when the program is launched, or when the computer starts.  Data stored in RAM is temporary, and is added or removed based on programs or the Operating System.  

### Hard Drive/ROM (Read-Only Memory):
Where permanent data is stored on the computer (the hard drive).  This information is written to disk and stays there until it is modified or deleted.  RAM reads information from the hard drive, into memory, then sends it to the processor.

### Input Devices
This hardware sends information to a computer, like a keyboard, mouse, camera, microphone, etc.  The input is processed by the computer, and can also perform certain functions.  A mouse click can open a program, and a keyboard can add text to a file, or run programs in the terminal.

### Output Devices
This type of hardware receives information from the computer, and can display it to the user, send it to other devices, etc.  Devices include monitors, printers, speakers, etc.
